## About
Hi, the reCREARTIVE team is waiting for you!

We have created a bot that will train your creativity and share with you a look at the world of different artists.

Solve tasks or just look at the world the way different artists did, and then try to use their methods.

Press the button to get a task for the day or come up with your own and write it to us. Who knows who will get it :)

Also, if you want to receive a new task every day, just click the "notify" button, and you will become creative every day.

P.s. : By the way, you can throw us your favorite stickers to make our communication more fun!
