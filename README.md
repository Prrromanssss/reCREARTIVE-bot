## About
Hi, the reCREARTIVE team is waiting for you!

We have created a bot that will train your creativity and share with you a look at the world of different artists.

Solve tasks or just look at the world the way different artists did, and then try to use their methods.

Press the button to get a task for the day or come up with your own and write it to us. Who knows who will get it :)

Also, if you want to receive a new task every day, just click the "notify" button, and you will become creative every day.

P.s. : By the way, you can throw us your favorite stickers to make our communication more fun!



## Functional

* __/help__ - help (learn available commands)

### Tasks
* __/get_task__ - get the task
* __/write_task__- send the task that another participant will receive
* __/confirm__ - confirm the task (what if you made a mistake :) )
* __/not_confirm__ - cancel the task recording (and really made a mistake :( )

"confirm" and "not_confirm" used after button "write_task".

### Notifications
* __/notify_settings__ - set up notifications (you donâ€™t want us to wake you up, do you? Set up the time zone and time for sending notifications) or find out about the time already selected
* __/notify__ - enable notifications
* __/exist_notify__ - find out about existing notifications (and suddenly
 have you set everything up yet? )
* __/not_notify__ - turn off notifications (after that, notifications will be turned off)

### Stickers
* __/stickers__ - set up your favorite stickers (these stickers will come with other messages)
* __/add_stickers__ - add stickers (after clicking this button stickers will be added to your collection
* __/del_stickers__ - remove stickers (when you get tired of them)

talk seriously). Used after buttons "add_stickers" and "del_stickers".
